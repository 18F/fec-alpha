A place to explore and evolve a new site for the Federal Election Commission.

## Issue Format
We use GitHub issues to track our tasks. In order for issues to be written in a way that both the writer and the reader understands what's actually going on, here's the outline we try to follow:
 
1. Goal: a quick blurb on what this issue is trying to accomplish
2. Completion Criteria: when will we know that this issue has been completed?
3. Tasks to completion:
    - [ ] Use 
    - [ ] Markdown
    - [ ] Checklists 
4. Dependencies (optional): What other issues out there need to be completed before you can do this one?
